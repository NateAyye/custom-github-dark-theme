   - **UI**: For all changes to the "outer UI", like (status bar, file navigation etc.), take a look at the [Theme Color](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color) reference.
   - **Syntax**: For changes to the "code highlighting", examine the syntax scopes by invoking the [`Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide#scope-inspector) command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) in the Extension Development Host window.
